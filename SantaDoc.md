## Introduction

The Secret Santa Website facilitates several essential processes to ensure the smooth and effective management of Secret Santa events within our organization. It begins with admin registration, where new administrators can easily create accounts by providing necessary details like their name, email, and password. Once this information is provided, the system validates it for accuracy, and upon successful validation, a new admin account is created, directing the admin to the login page for access.

Once logged in, administrators can navigate to the home page, where they are presented with various options to manage the Secret Santa event. One crucial feature is the QR code generation tool, allowing admins to generate unique QR codes for each participant, simplifying the process of assigning Secret Santas. These generated QR codes can be saved and distributed to employees, providing a seamless way for everyone to access their Secret Santa assignments.

The website also offers employee management functionalities, enabling admins to view, add, or delete employee details as needed. This feature ensures that participant information remains up-to-date and accurate throughout the event. Additionally, admins can easily access Secret Santa records to oversee and manage the gift exchange process effectively.

Moreover, the Secret Santa Website automates email notifications, sending them out on December 26th to inform participants of their assigned Secret Santas. These emails contain all the necessary details, ensuring clarity and transparency in the gift exchange process. Overall, the website streamlines the organization and execution of Secret Santa events, making it a valuable tool for creating memorable holiday experiences within our organization.

## Identifying the Need
We noticed some issues during our previous office Christmas celebrations, especially concerning the organization of our Secret Santa gift exchange. Managing it manually led to confusion and made it challenging to ensure fairness for everyone involved. People often became confused about who they were supposed to give gifts to, which dampened the fun of the event.

Our mentors and Rashmi Chaudhary, Ma'am, identified these problems and realized the need for a better way to manage our Secret Santa event. They assigned the task to find a solution to the January intern. Everyone pitched in with their ideas, and among them, Aman's idea was chosen. The task of implementing the solution was then assigned to Aman, Aditi, and Irfan.

# Locators In Selenium (TestNG Priority Attribute)

Selenium WebDriver is a powerful tool for automating web applications. Locators are used to identify elements on a web page, and TestNG's priority attribute allows you to prioritize the execution order of test methods.

#### Locating Elements with Selenium WebDriver

1. **ID Locator:**
   - Use `driver.findElement(By.id("element_id"))` to locate elements by their ID attribute.

2. **Name Locator:**
   - Use `driver.findElement(By.name("element_name"))` to locate elements by their Name attribute.

3. **Class Name Locator:**
   - Use `driver.findElement(By.className("element_class"))` to locate elements by their Class Name attribute.

4. **Tag Name Locator:**
   - Use `driver.findElement(By.tagName("tag_name"))` to locate elements by their HTML tag.

5. **Link Text Locator:**
   - Use `driver.findElement(By.linkText("link_text"))` to locate anchor elements by their visible text.

6. **Partial Link Text Locator:**
   - Use `driver.findElement(By.partialLinkText("partial_link_text"))` to locate anchor elements by partial visible text.

7. **XPath Locator:**
   - Use `driver.findElement(By.xpath("xpath_expression"))` to locate elements using XPath.

8. **CSS Selector Locator:**
   - Use `driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("css_selector"))` to locate elements using CSS selectors.

#### Using TestNG Priority Attribute

The priority attribute in TestNG allows you to prioritize the order of test method execution.

1. **Specify Priority in TestNG Annotations:**
   - Use the `priority` attribute in `@Test` annotation to specify the execution order of test methods.
   - TestNG will execute the test methods in ascending order of their priority values.

# Containerization
Containerization is a method of packaging, distributing, and running applications and their dependencies within isolated environments called containers. Each container encapsulates the application along with its runtime environment, libraries, and dependencies, ensuring consistency and portability across different computing environments.
  ## Technologies Used: Podman
Overview:
Podman is a containerization tool that provides a Docker-compatible interface for managing containers and images. Unlike Docker, Podman operates as a daemonless container engine, which means it doesn't require a central daemon process running in the background. Instead, containers are managed directly by the user or by system services.
   ###     Backend Image Creation
     Dockerfile:
     Dockerfile
     Copy code
    # Use a base image
    FROM node:20

    # Set working directory
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy package.json and package-lock.json
    COPY ./package*.json ./

    # Install dependencies
    RUN npm install

    # Copy backend source code into the container
    COPY . .
 
    # Expose port 9002
    EXPOSE 9002

    # Command to run the backend server
    CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]

   -> Dependencies:
Express: Web framework for Node.js, used for building APIs and handling HTTP requests.
Mongoose: 
MongoDB object modeling tool, used for interacting with MongoDB databases.
Other dependencies specific to your application, such as authentication libraries, validation middleware, etc.
Make sure to list these dependencies in your package.json file.

-> Build Process:
Prepare the Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile with the provided contents and place it in the root directory of your backend source code.

Define Dependencies: Ensure that your backend application's dependencies are listed in a package.json file in the same directory as the Dockerfile. Include any necessary Node.js packages and libraries required for your application.

Build the Image: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command to build the backend image:

    podman build -t backend-image .
This command will build the Docker image using the instructions defined in the Dockerfile and tag it with the name backend-image.
Verify the Image: Once the build process completes successfully, you can verify that the backend image was created by running:

    podman images
You should see backend-image listed among the images.

### Frontend Image Creation
-> Docker File:

    # Use a base image
    FROM node:20

    # Set working directory
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy package.json and package-lock.json
    COPY ./package*.json ./

    # Install dependencies
    RUN npm install

    # Copy frontend source code into the container
    COPY . .

    # Expose port 3000
    EXPOSE 3000

    # Command to start the frontend server
    CMD ["npm", "start"]

->  Dependencies:
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router: Declarative routing for React applications.
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
Other dependencies specific to your frontend application, such as state management libraries (Redux, MobX), UI component libraries (Material-UI, Bootstrap), etc.
Make sure to list these dependencies in your package.json file.

->Build Process:
Prepare the Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile with the provided contents and place it in the root directory of your frontend source code.

Define Dependencies: Ensure that your frontend application's dependencies are listed in a package.json file in the same directory as the Dockerfile. Include any necessary Node.js packages and libraries required for your application.

->Build the Image: 
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command to build the frontend image:
Copy code
       
    podman build -t frontend-image .
This command will build the Docker image using the instructions defined in the Dockerfile and tag it with the name frontend-image.

-> Verify the Image: Once the build process completes successfully, you can verify that the frontend image was created by running:
Copy code

    podman images
You should see frontend-image listed among the images.

### Pod Creation for running whole application Together:

First we need to create ENV for our database so we can connect it from anywhere weather on local host or on Cluster create an .env file in backend and inside it mention like this
    ![image](https://github.com/amancoder17/Secret_Santa-v1/assets/97497884/f8201800-8db6-4e74-ac10-863675073193)

Now Create a pod and using port mapping for frontend and backend server:
     
     podman pod create --name POD_NAME \
       	-p 3000:3000 -p 9002:9002 
 now pod is create a frontend container inside the pod using this 
      
      podman run -idt \
       	--pod POD_NAME \
       	--name CONTANIER_NAME FRONTEND_IMAGE_NAME
now create a backend container with Database url as env while creating container using this
      
       podman run -itd \
       	--pod POD_NAME\
       	-v $(pwd):/app \
       	--env DATABASE_URL=\
       	--name BACKEND_CONTAINER_NAME BACKEND_IMAGE_NAME 

Now Check pod is created using this command 

    podman pod ps

Happy using website on your server by entering the URL.
